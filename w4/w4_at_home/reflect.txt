What I learned:
I leaned about creating a constructor, how to overload a constructor and the use of This.
1.      Safe empty state is a state where all the instance variables are set to 0 or ‘/0’ if it is a string. This would prevent garbage values to be displayed if the client calls a display function without setting any values or if set those values as default if data entered isn’t valid.
2.      By using the isEmpty() function when I want to check if the object is empty or not for my display() and name() function.
3.      Since canTravelWith(…) is a member function declared in the class, it can access the private data of the class.
